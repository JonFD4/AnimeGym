### Forking the Repository:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to contribute to.
   - Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner to create your own copy of the repository.

2. **Clone Your Forked Repository:**

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git
     cd your-forked-repo
     ```

### Setting Up Remote Upstream:

3. **Add Upstream Remote:**
   - Add the original repository as the upstream remote to stay updated with changes.
     ```bash
     git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-repo-owner/original-repo.git
     ```

4. **Verify Remotes:**
   - Verify that both origin (your fork) and upstream (original repository) remotes are correctly set.
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```

### Collaborating and Developing:

5. **Create a Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-branch
     ```

6. **Make Changes:**
   - Make changes to the codebase.

7. **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     ```

8. **Push Changes to Your Fork:**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository.
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-branch
     ```

### Collaborating and Contributing:

9. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) to the original repository.
   - Provide a detailed description of your changes.

10. **Review and Merge:**
    - Wait for code reviews and address any feedback.
    - Once approved, the repository owner can merge your changes.

### Keeping Your Fork Updated:

11. **Fetch Upstream Changes:**
    - Regularly fetch changes from the upstream repository.
      ```bash
      git fetch upstream
      ```

12. **Merge Upstream Changes:**
    - Merge the upstream changes into your local main branch.
      ```bash
      git checkout main
      git merge upstream/main
      ```

13. **Push Upstream Changes to Your Fork:**
    - Push the merged changes to your fork.
      ```bash
      git push origin main
      ```
